## Introduction
This repo contains the implementation of our proposed fire segmentation method, the prerequisite libraries, and link of our newly created dataset we have used in our experiments. For testing purpose we also provide a trained model weights and test fire images.

---
This code is written with Anaconda python 3.7. Install the Anaconda python 3.7 and clone the repo with the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/hayatkhan8660-maker/Fire_Seg_Dataset.git
cd Fire_Seg_Dataset
```

Here is the link to access our newly created fire segmentation dataset.
